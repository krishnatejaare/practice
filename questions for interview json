The intent is to take a real json object, pull it into whichever programming language the candidate wants. Parse it into a native structure and then be able to print out specific keys and values at will.

For example:

Find the average collection_time_in_millis across both nodes for both OLD and YOUNG gcs
or

Find the maximum peak_max_in_bytes used by both nodes in the old pools
Have fun with it.. :)
